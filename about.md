Hi, I’m Dan, a technologist, artist, musician and maker from upstate New York. I’ve live at the intersection of creativity and engineering, where a new idea is just as exciting as the process of building it.

This blog is my workshop in written form. Here you’ll find a mix of:

- **Hands-on maker projects** — from Arduino experiments to sensors, LEDs, microcontrollers, and whatever new gadget shows up on my bench.
- **Software engineering and DevOps deep dives** — automation, tooling, workflows, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and the occasional exploration of “how it really works.”
- **Creative and technical mashups** — art projects powered by code, electronics blended with design, and the kind of tinkering that doesn’t fit neatly into any category.
- **Random curiosities** — if something sparks my interest, odds are it’ll show up here in some form.

Feel free to poke around, try things out, and reach out if something I’ve created sparks an idea of your own.
